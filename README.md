# Lucid - The security web test framework

As more and more modern day applications are moving towards
container based solutions hidden behind a cluster load balancer,
the tools need to adapt to the web security engineer; thus lucid.

This tool aims to automate security monitoring and reporting in a way that 
is friendly to people that aren't familar with the tool and powerful enough
to highlight areas of concern.
